                 Need more than just a summary, but less than a wiki's worth of information about popular manga?
                 </p>
              <p>
                As readers, we know that investing our free time into reading can be a risk. We could end up reading something we don't like, or finding out that a series has dozens of titles to its name. Even if we're fans, there are so many other books we want to read and talk about with others, and not enough time in the world!
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, it's basically the same for manga. Big-name titles like <i>Naruto</i> easily have dozens of volumes, without including spin-offs. Other titles, like <i>Dr. Stone</i> and <i>Demon Slayer</i>, are only a little over 20 volumes each, but that can still be a lot to ask for in terms of reading time. Even detailed wikis can provide a lot of information, but maybe more than what you're looking for.
              </p>
              <p><i>Popular Titles 101</i> is here to give you the simple details you should know about popular manga titles, including the premise, characters, story length, and anime adaptations.</p> 
             <h2>Demon Slayer</h2>

              <p><b>Premise:</b> Tanjiro Kamado is a hard-working young man trying to provide for his family that lives in the mountains by selling charcoal. Tragedy strikes when he returns home one day, only to find that almost everyone has been killed by demons. The only survivor is his sister, Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon herself. </p>
              <p> Despite her transformation, Nezuko still shows signs of her humanity, and so Tanjiro defends her from a high-ranking member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Seeing Tanjiro's determination, he sends Tanjiro to a master to begin training to become a Demon Slayer himself, and find a way to turn Nezuko back into a human.
              </p>
              <p><b>Important Characters:</b> The story follows <b>Tanjiro</b> and <b>Nezuko, </b> a pair of siblings that lost their family due to a demon attack.</p>
              <p><b>Tanjiro</b> is a kind, young man who took over the role of main provider for his family after his father died. After the rest of his family is killed by demons, leaving only him and his sister, he trains under a master to join the Demon Slayer Corps, and eventually find a way to turn his sister back into a human. He uses a Water Breathing sword style.</p>
              <p><b>Nezuko</b> is Tanjiro's younger sister. She is the sole survivor of a demon attack that killed the rest of her family. Instead, she was turned into a demon. She retains some of her humanity, protecting humans from other demons, and relying on sleep to recover her strength rather than feeding off humans. She is weak to sunlight, and often hides in a box that Tanjiro carries on his back.
              </p>
              <p><b>Zenitsu</b> joins the Demon Slayer Corps around the same time as Tanjiro, and joins him on his travels. He often has problems fighting unless he's asleep or unconscious, due to his cowardly personality. He develops a crush on Nezuko after meeting her. He specialises in Thunder Breathing sword techniques.  
              </p>
              <p><b>Inosuke</b> also joins the Demon Slayer Corps around the same time as Tanjiro and Zenitsu. He was raised by wild boars following the death of his mother, and is often seen wearing a boar mask. Often, he acts in a hot-headed and brash manner, and is quick to challenge his allies. He has his own self-taught style called Beast Breathing. </p>
              <p><b>The Demon Slayer Corps</b> is a secret organization that protects humans from demons. The top warriors are known as the <b>Hashira</b>. </p>
              <p><b>Total Volumes:</b> The manga is completed at 23 volumes. In addition, there are 3 light novels: <i>The Flower of Happiness</i>, <i>One-Winged Butterfly</i>, and <i>Signs from the Wind</i>.</p>
              <p> <b>Anime Adaptation?:</b> As of December 2023, the anime is still airing, and currently has 50+ episodes. There are also 2 movies: <i>Mugen Train</i> and <i>To the Swordsmith Village</i>.</p>
