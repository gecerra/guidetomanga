                Manga is an awesome form of visual storytelling that can really engage readers, especially young adults. 
                However, for those unfamiliar with the format, or have their hesitations picking it up, it can be confusing and intimidating to get into. 
                That's not even getting into how some big name titles can have dozens, even hundreds of volumes to their name!  
                </p>
                <p>
                Well, you don't need to read hundreds of volumes of one particular title to keep up! 
                This guide will give you the basics of some popular manga series, and even recommend some beginner-friendly ones to get you started on your reading journey.
                </p>
              <p>
               If that's not enough for you, you can also check the Resources tab for project ideas, the basics to reading manga, and English-language publishers to browse for titles. 
               There should be a little something for everyone, so even if you're already an avid reader, hopefully you'll find something new to enjoy and/or share with others!

           <h1 id="article-title"> About </h1>
            <h2> Who am I? </h2>
              <p class="border">
                My name is Grace, and I'm a life-long manga reader and anime fan. I'm also a candidate to receive my Masters of Library and Information Science from Dominican University.
              </p>
              <p>
                 As part of my studies, I made this website as a handy reference tool for librarians to have when trying to develop their collections, get some program ideas, or just figure out what the kids are talking about.
                </p>
            <h2> Why manga? </h2>
              <p>
                Besides being a fan of it myself, I think manga is a great way of connecting with those who might otherwise be reluctant readers. 
                It offers an alternate form of storytelling that can't be captured by other formats. 
                It can also work as an introduction to various aspects of Japanese culture. 
                Many manga often have cultural notes at the back of the volumes so you can follow along better!
