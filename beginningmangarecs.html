             <p>
               Based on the video game <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Deserted Island Diary</i> is a silly, slice-of-life manga focusing on four humans that move to a deserted island. There's <b> Coroyuki, </b> who gets caught up in his own excitement, <b>Benben,</b> the bookworm, <b>Himepoyo,</b> who often tries to get out of doing her own work, and <b>Guchan,</b> who you'll often catch sleeping.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together, the four of them often get caught up in a variety of schenanigans, such as visiting other islands in their dreams, trying to get rich by selling turnips, and even getting a job designing vacation homes. They also meet a variety of strange characters, such as <b>Jack,</b> the Czar of Halloween, or fan-favorite <b>Raymond</b>. And of course, it's not <i>Animal Crossing </i> if there's no <b>Tom Nook,</b> the tanuki infamous for charging players thousands to pay off their house mortgages and expand the rooms. 
              </p>
              <p> <b>Why this manga?:</b> I'll start off by admitting some bias here by admitting that I'm a big fan of <i>New Horizons</i>. Though I've been familiar with the franchise from its GameCube release, this particular entry added the ability to decorate outdoors and transform your island pretty much any way you want. It offers a relaxing, low-stakes experience, which is carried over into this manga, even with all the antics the characters get into.
              </p>
              <p>It's also a pretty low barrier to entry. You don't need to be super familiar with <i>New Horizons</i> to enjoy the story, especially since the first volume offers character profiles to tell you who's who. With the stories being more episodic in nature, it's easier to follow along even after not reading it for a long period of time. Lastly, it has a fun, chibi art-style that keeps to the spirit of the game while also appealing to younger readers.
